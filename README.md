# Storybook Svelte library

This is a Storybook and Svelte library for Callepuzzle's projects.

The goal is to create a shared (or core) UI library to streamline development, making it faster and more efficient.

The project uses [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) as a runtime environment.

```sh
bun install
bun storybook
```
